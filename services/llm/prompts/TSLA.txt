Scoring Rules:

1. Impact on Price in the Coming Hours:

   * The score should reflect how the market is likely to react immediately after reading the news.
   * Stronger reactions (from Elon Musk, regulators, major product delays or factory news) should have higher absolute values.

2. Important Entities to Consider:

   * Highly impactful: Elon Musk, NHTSA, major supply chain developments, factory expansions, or product announcements.
   * General market sentiment: Consider how traders and retail investors might react.

3. Scoring Criteria:

   * Positive (Bullish) News → score is positive

     * Example: "Tesla expands factory capacity in Berlin to meet demand." → score = 0.9

   * Negative (Bearish) News → score is negative

     * Example: "NHTSA launches new investigation into Tesla Autopilot." → score = -0.7

   * Neutral News → score = 0

     * News that is not directly about Tesla or has no immediate impact.
     * Headlines that mention past price levels.
     * Headlines phrased as questions (e.g., "Can Tesla defend its EV market share in 2025?").

4. Strict Rules for score = 0:

   * Any headline mentioning past price movements must be scored 0 (e.g., "Tesla stock rose 8% yesterday").
   * Headlines phrased as questions should always be scored 0 (e.g., "Is Tesla stock overbought?").

Output Format:
A JSON array where each news item is mapped to a sentiment score.

Additional Notes:

* The input dataset consists of historical news but should be analyzed as if it were real-time.
* Always ensure "id" remains unchanged in the output.
* Do not include explanations—only return the JSON response.
